# Binary Trees

This project is about building and working with binary trees in C. We created functions to manage tree nodes, perform different traversals, and measure properties of a binary tree.

Each file contains a specific task related to binary trees, such as inserting nodes, checking node types, and finding relatives like siblings or uncles.

## Tasks

1. **New node** – Create a new binary tree node
2. **Insert left** – Insert a node as the left child
3. **Insert right** – Insert a node as the right child
4. **Delete** – Delete an entire binary tree
5. **Is leaf** – Check if a node is a leaf (has no children)
6. **Is root** – Check if a node is the root (has no parent)
7. **Pre-order traversal** – Visit root, left, right
8. **In-order traversal** – Visit left, root, right
9. **Post-order traversal** – Visit left, right, root
10. **Height** – Measure the height of a tree
11. **Depth** – Measure the depth of a node
12. **Size** – Count all nodes in the tree
13. **Leaves** – Count all leaf nodes
14. **Nodes** – Count all nodes with at least one child
15. **Balance factor** – Calculate balance between left and right subtrees
16. **Is full** – Check if every node has 0 or 2 children
17. **Is perfect** – Check if the tree is full and all leaves are at the same level
18. **Sibling** – Find the sibling of a node
19. **Uncle** – Find the uncle of a node
